We now introduce a new wrinkle into our ODEs: second derivatives. Together, first- and second-order ODEs comprise the overwhelming majority of differential equations used in mathematical models. To some degree this traces back to Newton's laws of motion; in $F=ma$, acceleration is the second derivative of position. In fact, $F=ma$ is the original justification for the term "forcing function" that we have used for a while, as it plays the role of an actual external force acting on a system.

First-order ODEs are all about growth and decay. Second-order ODEs add oscillation to the party. They also require us to update some of our theoretical understanding of the structure of solutions.
