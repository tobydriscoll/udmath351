RRE Form,A matrix is in RRE form (reduced row-echelon form) if it meets all of these requirements: (1) Any rows of all zeros appear below all nonzero rows; (2) The leading nonzero of any row is a one; (3) Every leading 1 that is lower than another leading 1 is also to the right of it; (3) Every leading 1 is the only nonzero in its column.,Hehn

Asymptotically Stable ,"The steady state x̂ is asymptotically stable if there is a positive number 𝛿 such that the limit as t approaches infinity of x(t, X) = x̂ whenever |X - x̂| < 𝛿 .",Hehn
Stability,"The steady state x̂ is said to be stable if, for any 𝜖 > 0, you can ensure that |x(t, X) - x̂| < 𝜖 for all time whenever |X - x̂| < 𝛿, where 𝛿 depends on 𝜖. If there is no such way to choose 𝛿, then x̂ is unstable. ",Hehn
Simple Stability Test,"If f '(x̂) < 0, then x̂ is asymptotically stable. If f '(x̂) > 0, then x̂ is unstable. f '(x̂) = 0 is ambiguous, so another analysis is needed in order to determine its stability. ",Hehn
