    "For this part of the course we will be concerned with a **first-order ODE** (ordinary differential equation) written in the standard form\n",

    "We call $x$ the **dependent variable** and $t$ the **independent variable**. We use these particular variable names for theoretical discussion, but in practice the variables could be named anything. The term *first-order* indicates that only the first derivative appears and not $x''$, $x'''$, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $f(t,x)$, the goal is to find the unknown function $x(t)$. A **solution*  to the ODE is a function $x(t)$ that makes {eq}`eq-preview-standard` a true equation when inserted. Finding solutions usually takes some effort, and for most realistic problems it cannot be done at all. However, if someone proposes a solution, it's easy to check whether that is the case: substitute it into the ODE and manipulate it until you can ascertain whether the equation holds. Some examples follow below.\n",

    "where $a$ is a constant. What kind of function has a constant derivative? A linear function. The solution is $x(t) = at + C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. In words, the ODE says the solution has a constant rate of change, and therefore the solution must have a constant slope.\n",

As usual, the indefinite integration implies an arbitrary constant. As simple as this problem is, it reveals an important fact.\n",

    "A named quantity such as $a$ that is neither the independent nor the dependent variable is often called a **parameter**. A parameter is assumed to be constant unless it is otherwise written, e.g., as $a(t)$, to show the dependence on $t$. A common convention is to make parameters be positive where reasonable. In that case, a negative value would include an explicit sign such as in $-a$.\n",
