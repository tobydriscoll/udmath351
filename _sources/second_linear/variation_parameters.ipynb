    "{numref}`section-second_linear-const_coeff` and {numref}`section-second_linear-complex` explained how to find the general solution $x_h(t)$ of a homoegenous linear system $\\opA[x]=0$. We need to perform that same step for a nonhomogeneous problem $\\opA[x]=f$, but then also find a particular solution of the original equation. One possibility is to adapt the *variation of parameters* technique used for first-order problems in {numref}`section-first_order-vop`.\n",
