    "There are many ways to characterize singular matrices, but only a few of them are computationally attractive. One that stands out is a function of square matrices called the **determinant**. (You probably saw some $2\\times 2$ and $3\\times 3$ determinants in vector calculus. This is the same thing.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A definition of the determinant from fundamentals is actually quite tricky. We are going to take a shortcut and \"define\" it by a formula for computing it. The $2\\times 2$ case is easy:\n",

    "The formula {eq}`eq-determinants-cofactor`, which is called **cofactor expansion**, is recursive: the $n\\times n$ case is defined in terms of the $(n-1)\\times (n-1)$ case, and so on all the way back down to $2\\times 2$. \n",
