    "# Linear systems\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first learned algebra, the focus was on solving equations. The simplest equations are those that depend linearly on the unknowns. We'll be learning how to do this in a systematic fashion that covers all the possibilities for any number of equations and unknowns.\n",

    "## One variable\n",
    "\n",
    "It might feel silly, but let's review what it means to solve the linear equation\n",

    "$$ax = b$$\n",

    "for $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $a\\neq 0$, there is a unique solution, $x=b/a$.\n",
    "- Otherwise,\n",
    "   - If also $b=0$, then every value of $x$ is a valid solution.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, there are no solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that no matter how many equations and variables we have, the only three possibilites are the ones above: zero, one, or infinitely many solutions. The main difference is that the condition \"$a=0$\" has to be generalized.\n",

    "::::{proof:definition} Consistent linear system\n",
    "A linear system that has at least one solution is called **consistent**. Otherwise, it is **inconsistent**.\n",

    "There is some easy geometric intuition here. Each equation represents a straight line in the plane, and solving both equations simultaneously means finding an intersection of these lines. Our cases above translate directly into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the lines are not parallel, there is a unique solution.\n",
    "- Otherwise,\n",
    "   - If the lines are identical, there are infinitely many solutions.\n",
    "   - Otherwise, there are no solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not hard to turn those statements into algebraic conditions. The slopes of the two lines are (ignoring infinities for a moment) $-a/b$ and $-c/d$, and we can say the slopes are equal if and only if $ad=bc$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $ad \\neq bc$, there is a single solution.\n",
    "- Otherwise,\n",
